My audio narrative project depicts the life of a boy. It begins with the child's birth and eventually segways into his early childhood years. The boy contines to age and he eventually leaves home which is depicted by the sound of a car pullin gout of the driveway. He falls in love and finally has a child of his own. The narrative dispalys the circle of life as it begins and ends with a heartbeat sound.
